  <p class="w3-center"><em>Glacier National Park</em></p>

  <p>Glacier National Park is a national park located in the U.S. state of Montana, on the Canada–United States border with the Canadian provinces of Alberta and British Columbia. The park encompasses over 1 million acres (4,000 km2) and includes parts of two mountain ranges (sub-ranges of the Rocky Mountains), over 130 named lakes, more than 1,000 different species of plants, and hundreds of species of animals. This vast pristine ecosystem is the centerpiece of what has been referred to as the "Crown of the Continent Ecosystem", a region of protected land encompassing 16,000 square miles. The current Superintendent is Jeff Mow.

The region that became Glacier National Park was first inhabited by Native Americans. Upon the arrival of European explorers, it was dominated by the Blackfeet in the east and the Flathead in the western regions. Under pressure, the Blackfeet ceded the mountainous parts of their treaty lands in 1895 to the federal government; it later became part of the park. Soon after the establishment of the park on May 11, 1910, a number of hotels and chalets were constructed by the Great Northern Railway These historic hotels and chalets are listed as National Historic Landmarks and a total of 350 locations are on the National Register of Historic Places. By 1932 work was completed on the Going-to-the-Sun Road, later designated a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark, which provided greater accessibility for automobiles into the heart of the park.</p>

      <p>Glacier National Park has more than 200 waterfalls scattered throughout the park. Virginia Falls – Dropping more than 50 feet off a sheer cliff face, Virginia Falls just might be one of the most beautiful falls I've ever seen. Additionally, waterfall aficionados will get a chance to see St. Mary Falls, and two other very impressive, but unnamed falls along the way as well.

St. Mary Falls – If you're looking for a very short hike to see an awesome waterfall, this should fit the bill.

Redrock Falls – An outstanding choice for an easy hike. In addition to a very impressive series of cascades and falls, you'll also visit two picturesque sub-alpine lakes, and maybe even have a chance to see a moose along the way.

Running Eagle Falls – "Trick Falls" is a must see in the Two Medicine Area. It's a very easy, handicap accessible trail.

Florence FallsFlorence Falls – I would probably have to rank this as the second most impressive waterfall that can be reached on a day hike in Glacier National Park. The reason I have it ranking fifth on this list is a result of the distance you have to walk to reach the falls. Additionally, the trail stays within the confines of the forest for most of its length. Having said that though, there is a point on the trail, at Mirror Pond, that just might be one of the most scenic spots in the entire park.

Johns Lake Loop – An easy loop hike off the Going-to-the-Sun Road that visits Sacred Dancing Cascade and McDonald Falls.

Apikuni Falls – Beautiful falls in a small box canyon.

Rockwell Falls – The trail travels through several open meadows in the Two Medicine valley. You'll also have a good chance of seeing a moose along the way.

Baring Falls – Very easy hike off the Going-to-the-Sun Road on the eastern side of the park.

Ptarmigan Falls – This is one of the more impressive falls in the park. However, steep terrain around the falls makes it virtually impossible to get a close-up view. Moreover, trees block a full view of the falls from top to bottom. This waterfall, however, makes my top 10 list because the hike offers outstanding views of the Many Glacier Valley for most of its length.

        <div class="content">
            <ol>
                <li>Glacier National Park is a part of the worlds first international peace park.</li>
                <p>The vision for a park was to celebrate peace and friendship between the United States and Canada. In 1932 Glacier and Waterton Lakes National Park in Alberton, Canada, were designated the Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park.</p>
                <li>Glacier straddles the Continental Divide, allowing for extreme weather.</li>
                <p>In one instance just outside the park’s eastern boundary in Browning, Montana, the temperature was noted as dropping 100 degrees in just 24 hours. </p>
                <li>Evidence of human use in the area dates back over 12,000 years.</li>
                <p>Archeological evidence shows human occupation of this landscape dating back to the retreat of the Ice Age glaciers 12,000 years ago. These mountains still hold spiritual significance for the local Blackfeet, Salish, and Kootenai Tribes. </p>
                <li>Glacier has welcomed over 100 million visitors to the park.</li>
                <p>The parks annual visitation has been rising over the past five years, hitting a record high of 2,946,681 in 2016. Glacier has certainly come a long way since 1911 with an annual visitation of only 4,000. </p>
                <li>The largest glacier in the park is 0.7 square miles.</li>
                <p>Of the 26 glaciers present, Blackfoot Glacier is the largest glacier in the park.</p>
                <li>Glacier holds over 700 miles of hiking trails.</li>
                <p>Over half of the visitors to Glacier National Park hit the trail to see some of the outstanding scenic views the park has to offer. With opportunities for both long backpacking trips and shorter hikes, there is something for everyone.</p>
                <li>Glaciers wildlife has hardly changed since it was first discovered.</li>
                <p>Home to 71 species of mammals, Glaciers ecosystem has essentially remained intact and undisturbed. This is mostly because of its large acreage and early protection efforts, but nonetheless the parks preservation of species since early European explorations is quite impressive. </p>

            <ol>
                <li>Glacier National Park is a part of the worlds first international peace park.</li>
                <p>The vision for a park was to celebrate peace and friendship between the United States and Canada. In 1932 Glacier and Waterton Lakes National Park in Alberton, Canada, were designated the Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park.</p>
                <li>Glacier straddles the Continental Divide, allowing for extreme weather.</li>
                <p>In one instance just outside the park’s eastern boundary in Browning, Montana, the temperature was noted as dropping 100 degrees in just 24 hours. </p>
                <li>Evidence of human use in the area dates back over 12,000 years.</li>
                <p>Archeological evidence shows human occupation of this landscape dating back to the retreat of the Ice Age glaciers 12,000 years ago. These mountains still hold spiritual significance for the local Blackfeet, Salish, and Kootenai Tribes. </p>
                <li>Glacier has welcomed over 100 million visitors to the park.</li>
                <p>The parks annual visitation has been rising over the past five years, hitting a record high of 2,946,681 in 2016. Glacier has certainly come a long way since 1911 with an annual visitation of only 4,000. </p>
                <li>The largest glacier in the park is 0.7 square miles.</li>
                <p>Of the 26 glaciers present, Blackfoot Glacier is the largest glacier in the park.</p>
                <li>Glacier holds over 700 miles of hiking trails.</li>
                <p>Over half of the visitors to Glacier National Park hit the trail to see some of the outstanding scenic views the park has to offer. With opportunities for both long backpacking trips and shorter hikes, there is something for everyone.</p>
                <li>Glaciers wildlife has hardly changed since it was first discovered.</li>
                <p>Home to 71 species of mammals, Glaciers ecosystem has essentially remained intact and undisturbed. This is mostly because of its large acreage and early protection efforts, but nonetheless the parks preservation of species since early European explorations is quite impressive. </p>

        <h2 class="title">About</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Glacier National Park is a national park located in the U.S. state of Montana, on the Canada/United States border with the Canadian provinces of Alberta and British Columbia. The park encompasses over 1 million acres and includes parts of two mountain ranges , over 130 named lakes, more than 1,000 different species of plants, and hundreds of species of animals. This vast pristine ecosystem is the centerpiece of what has been referred to as the "Crown of the Continent Ecosystem", a region of protected land encompassing 16,000 square miles. The current Superintendent is Jeff Mow. The region that became Glacier National Park was first inhabited by Native Americans. Upon the arrival of European explorers, it was dominated by the Blackfeet in the east and the Flathead in the western regions. Under pressure, the Blackfeet ceded the mountainous parts of their treaty lands in 1895 to the federal government; it later became part of the park. Soon after the establishment of the park on May 11, 1910, a number of hotels and chalets were constructed by the Great Northern Railway These historic hotels and chalets are listed as National Historic Landmarks and a total of 350 locations are on the National Register of Historic Places. By 1932 work was completed on the Going-to-the-Sun Road, later designated a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark, which provided greater accessibility for automobiles into the heart of the park.</p>

The Blackfeet controlled the prairies on the east side of Glacier, while the Salish, Pend d’Oreille, and Kootnei lived in the more forested west side. There is currently a 1.5-million acre Blackfeet Indian Reservation at Glacier.
